                    Dear Kez,
                    <br />
                    If there’s one thing I value now, it’s steadiness.

I don’t want anything rushed or emotionally overwhelming. If we ever move forward again, I’d want it to feel calm, intentional, and safe for both of us.

What I can offer now is consistency. Clear communication. Patience. The willingness to work through discomfort instead of pulling away from it.

Trust, to me, isn’t built through big promises. It’s built in small, steady actions over time. And that’s how I would want to approach this slowly, respectfully, and without pressure.

No expectations. Just honesty about where I stand.

                  <p>
                    Dear Kez,
                    <br />
                    The more I reflect, the more I realize na not everyone expresses love or emotions the same way and that’s okay.

I understand that sometimes you need space to process things. That when things feel too intense or overwhelming, your instinct is to step back and breathe. I don’t see that as something wrong. I see it as how you protect your peace.

If ever we take steps again, I want you to know I wouldn’t take that personally. Hindi ko i-interpret agad as rejection or pagkawala ng feelings. I’d rather understand where you’re coming from than react out of fear.

For me, patience would mean allowing that space without pressure. Honesty would mean we can say when we need distance or when we need reassurance without it turning into conflict.

I’m not trying to change you. I just want to meet you where you are. Slowly. Calmly. Without forcing anything.

If there’s something worth rebuilding, I believe it should feel safe for both of us not heavy, not overwhelming..
